		\tab \normalsize{Based off our last sprint, we believe that we should stay committed to keeping sprint meetings on Wednesday and Friday over Skype or Google Hangouts. Either forum will suffice. We are not in close proximity of each other, so at the current time, this is most convenient.}

	\section{Actions to start doing}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\tab \normalsize{Actions that we should partake in is better communication on forums such as Slack and being more organized with Scrum documents. We believe that fixing this will keep our developers focused, punctual, and in the loop of the current status of our sprint (outside of sprint meetings, that is). Also, we should keep disciplined on the key things that are needed to be discussed during the sprint meeting. Hence, we will follow the Scrum framework more religiously, and perform full stand-up meetings.}

	\section{Actions to keep doing}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\tab \normalsize{Things we should continue to do that will keep the dynamic of our group healthy is contributing and having a voice at Scrum meetings. We believe that adding more functionality in early stages will set us up for success in the long run.}
