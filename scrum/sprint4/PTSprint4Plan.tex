		\tab \normalsize{In short, we want to capitalize and fine tune the current features that we have, and add more features, if possible given the time frame.}

	\section{Task Listing}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item As a user, I want to save my configuration settings in local storage.
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: See if there is an Apache Cordova app that will let you easily save data in local storage (it is very likely that there is) (1 hour) 
			    \item Task 2: Create a Javascript function that will store "configuration settings" for the clock in local storage, using this plugin (3 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 4 hours
			\item As a user, I want to see a settings/configuration page just in case I forget the values I input for the clock augmentation.
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Create an HTML item and some jQuery magic so that when you click on the icon, it will dynamically show you your configuration settings (5 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Position this in the lower right corner of the clock view page (1 hour)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 6 hours
			\item As a user, I want at least two or three more animations as features to further visualize the physical time, relative to my location.
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Fine tune the already created features, and finish any user stories that weren't finished in the last sprint. (12 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Illustrate the different times of the sun, around the clock (dynamically place icons around the clock illustrating when it is sunset, sunrise, etc) (10 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			 Total: 22 hours
		\end{itemize}
