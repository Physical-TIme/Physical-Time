		\tab \normalsize{In short, for this sprint we aim to present a [hardcoded] augmented clock with a decent user interface to navigate to that feature, and other features.}
	\section{Task Listing}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item As a user, I want to see a augmented clock that displays a 24-hour time format in one clock rotation (usually 12 hours), with 4 hour divisions.
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Research and find a pluggable clock or d3 plugin to easily visualize a regular clock (3 hour)
			    \item Task 2: Tinker with the values in the clock to augment the value (3 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 6 hours
			\item  As a user, I want to see a decent UI in the works so that I may eas- ily navigate the application and know the exact purpose it serves (with no prior knowledge of the application).
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Learn about jQuery (2 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Write some boiler plate code for the application skeleton (6 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			Total: 8 hours
			\item As a developer, I want to integrate an easy-to-use visualization frame- work to create the clock (e.g. d3.js).
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item Task 1: Research about d3.js (1 hours)
			    \item Task 2: Take a look at other alternatives to d3 and tradeoffs in terms of user experience (UX) (3 hours)
			\end{itemize}
			 Total: 4 hours
		\end{itemize}
